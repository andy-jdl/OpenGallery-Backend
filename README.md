# Open Gallery — Backend

The Open Gallery Backend powers the Open Gallery browser extension by utilizing data from major museums’ and their publicly available APIs.
Explore and discover artworks across multiple institutions in a unified experience.

## Contributing

Museums and developers alike are warmly invited to contribute and help expand the collection.  
If your institution would like to be included, please open an issue to begin the onboarding process.

Alternatively, if you’d like to add support for a new museum API yourself:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Submit a pull request once your service integration is ready.

Inspiration for this project came from wanting to know where a painting was displayed. (I never did find out.)
